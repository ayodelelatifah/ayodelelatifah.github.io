    <H2>Biography</H2>
    <P>A detail-driven data analyst with a passion for logic and problem-solving with a growing interest in cloud
        engineering, i am very eager to expand my skill set and explore the world of software
        engineering. My interest in this program stemmed from my
        great analytic skills, logical thinking and desire for technical growth
        With a strong educational foundation and a unique blend of experience in healthcare and data analysis, i am
        poised to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.

        My educational journey began at Taw Bedrock School, where I developed a solid foundation in primary
        education. I then attended Altitude College for my secondary education, honing my critical thinking skills
        and laying the groundwork for my future academic pursuits.

        After completing my secondary education, I went on to study at the School of Health Information
        Management, Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), where I earned a degree in Health Information
        Management. This program equipped me with a deep understanding of healthcare systems, data management, and
        analytical techniques.

        I began my career as a Health Information Management Officer in 2018, where I worked for
        five years to ensure the accurate and efficient management of healthcare data. My experience in this role
        taught me the importance of attention to detail, organizational skills, and effective communication.

        In 2024, I transitioned into a Data Analyst role, where i applied my analytical mindset and technical
        skills to extract insights from complex data sets. My unique blend of experience in healthcare and data
        analysis enabled me to approach problems from a distinct perspective, making me a valuable asset to any
        organization.

        With a growing interest in backend engineering, I am now eager to expand my skill set and explore the
        world of software development. I am excited to leverage my analytical mindset, problem-solving skills, and
        passion for logic to build scalable, efficient, and reliable software solutions.</P>
